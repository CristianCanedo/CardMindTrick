# CardMindTrick
(First created approximately 12 weeks after studying C# - Major refactoring to take place in the upcoming weeks)


The program will shuffle the cards 3 times, each time you pick which pile your card lands in. After all shuffles, the computer will always reveal the card you had in mind.

## Outstanding Tasks
- [ ] Refactor shuffle functions
- [ ] Redesign to a more OO architecture
- [ ] Port to .NET Core Web App
