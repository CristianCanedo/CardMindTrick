# Card_Guessing_Game
The program will shuffle the cards 3 times, each time you pick which pile your card lands in. After all shuffles, the computer will always reveal the card you had in mind.

## Not Completed
The project is no where near satisfactory. It was written on my 12th week of learning C# last year. Serious refactoring will take
place in the future mainly focusing on shortening of the functions and improving the custom shuffle algorithm.
